<h4><strong>7. EU AND UK DATA PROTECTION </strong></h4>

<p class="title3">7.1 Certain Data Protection Rights</p>

<p>If we process any of the above personal data through our European and UK offices (or otherwise benefit from such rights by application of the EU General Data Protection Regulation), you have the following rights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
	<li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</li>
	<li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law.</li>
	<li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
	<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information&#39;s accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
	<li>Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party (commonly known as a &quot;right to portability&quot;). We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to information which you initially provided to us based on (i) your consent or (ii) the performance of a contract with you and where such information is being processed through automated means.</li>
	<li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to exercise your data protection rights, or to discuss any of the above rights, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:privacy@klgates.com">privacy@klgates.com</a></u>.</p>

<p>We will make reasonable efforts to comply with the aforementioned requests, unless such requests are prohibited by law, or there is a legitimate purpose to retain your personal data, in which case we will inform you without undue delay and in any case within 30 (thirty) days from the receipt of your request. We reserve the right to verify your identity before any request relating to your personal data processed by us.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with our answer or the way we process your personal data pursuant to this Privacy Policy, for EU residents, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority by <a href="http://https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">clicking here</a>&nbsp;or with the Data Protection Authority in your Member State, or for UK residents, with the <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk">Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office</a>.</p>

<p class="title3">7.2 Information Retention</p>

<p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which you provided it to us, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you (for example, for as long as you are our client or keep using the Website);</li>
	<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep client records for a certain period of time before we can delete them);</li>
	<li>Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position and for recordkeeping purposes (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ul>

<p class="title3">7.3 Data Transfers Outside of the EU or UK</p>

<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU or UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission or the UK Government, as applicable, which give personal information the same protection it has in &nbsp;the EU or the UK, as applicable.</li>
	<li>Where the above mechanisms are not sufficient for ensuring an adequate level of data protection we will implement supplemental measures to increase the protection of your personal data abroad.</li>
	<li>For additional information on the mechanisms used to protect your personal information, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:privacy@klgates.com">privacy@klgates.com</a></u>.</li>

<h5>Your Right to the Deletion of Your Personal Information&nbsp;</h5>

<p>You also may request that we delete (and direct our service providers to delete) the personal information that we have collected about you (your <strong>&ldquo;Request to Delete&rdquo;</strong>). &nbsp;However, there are limits to your right to delete your personal information under the CCPA. &nbsp;We may deny your Request to Delete your personal information when your personal information is needed for any of the following reasons, and we will tell you which reason or reasons apply if we do deny your request:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service that you requested, or to take actions that we reasonably anticipate in connection with our ongoing business relationship you or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
	<li>To detect security incidents; protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity.</li>
	<li>To debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
	<li>To exercise free speech, ensure the right of another California Consumer to exercise that California Consumer&rsquo;s right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
	<li>To comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.</li>
	<li>To engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if you have provided informed consent.</li>
	<li>To enable solely our internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>To comply with a legal obligation.</li>
	<li>To make other internal use of your personal information in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.</li>
</ul>

<h5>How to Make Requests to Know or Requests to Delete&nbsp;</h5>

<p>You may exercise your disclosure or deletion rights described above by calling us toll-free at &nbsp;844-916-1311, visiting &nbsp;<a href="https://klgatesdsr.ethicspoint.com">https://klgatesdsr.ethicspoint.com</a>, or emailing us at privacy@klgates.com. &nbsp;Please include in the Subject line the appropriate reference: &ldquo;CCPA Request-to-Know&rdquo; or &ldquo;CCPA Request-to-Delete.&rdquo; &nbsp;Provide appropriate identification and contact information and a brief description of your request.</p>

<p>If you submit a request in a manner that is not one of the designated methods of submission, we will either treat your request as if it had been submitted in accordance with these designated methods or provide you with specific directions on how to submit the request or remedy the deficiencies in your request, if any.</p>

<h5>Authorized Agents and Your Requests</h5>

<p>You may use an authorized agent to submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete. &nbsp;If you use an authorized agent, however, we will require that you (1) provide the authorized agent signed permission to submit the request, (2) verify your identity directly with us, and (3) directly confirm to us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. &nbsp;These tasks will not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. &nbsp;For your protection, we may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>

<h5>How We Verify and Process Your Requests</h5>

<p>Upon receiving your Request to Know or Request to Delete, we will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your requests. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We will respond to your request within 45 days barring any unforeseen complications. &nbsp;Should complications arise, we will respond to your request within 90 days and provide you with an explanation with the reason we will take more than 45 days to respond to your request.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To process your request, we will ask you for information that allows us to verify your identity and we will use that information only for that purpose. The information we request and the degree of verification you will need to provide will depend on the scope of your request. &nbsp;Requests for copies of specific pieces of your personal information may require additional information to verify your identity as compared to general Requests to Know. &nbsp;The information that we will need to verify your identity for Requests to Delete will depend on the nature of your request. &nbsp;For example, we may require a reasonably high degree of certainty for verification of a request to delete documents; by contrast, we may require only a reasonable degree of certainty for a request to delete browsing history. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. &nbsp;For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify you identity or cannot verify that a person claiming to be your agent has the authority to make the request on your behalf. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the degrees of certainty as described above, we will state so in response to your request and explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity. &nbsp;The firm will generally avoid requesting additional information from you for purposes of verification. &nbsp;If we do request additional information from you, it shall only be used for the purposes of (1) verifying your identity while you are seeking to exercise your rights under the CCPA, and (2) for security or fraud-prevention purposes. &nbsp;We will delete any new personal information collected for the purposes of verification as soon as practical after processing your request, except as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>In addition, we will not honor your request where an exception under the California law applies, such as where the disclosure of personal information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California Consumer or where the personal information we have about you is not subject to the CCPA&rsquo;s access or deletion rights. &nbsp;We also will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request for these reasons.</p>

<h5>Your Right to Be Free from Discrimination&nbsp;</h5>

<p>You have the right to be free from discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.&nbsp;</p>
