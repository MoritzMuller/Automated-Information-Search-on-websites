<h5>Regulatory and Representative Bodies</h5>

<p>We are authorised and regulated by the SRA. The SRA is an independent regulatory body and redress systems are provided through the SRA and the Legal Ombudsman. Our members are solicitors, registered foreign lawyers or otherwise approved managers regulated by the SRA in England &amp; Wales. Some members may be solely or additionally authorised to practise law in jurisdictions other than England &amp; Wales.</p>

<p><span class="title3">Our Professional Standards and Regulations</span><br />
Our professional&nbsp;standards and regulations&nbsp;may be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations">www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="title3">Handling of Clients&#39; Funds&nbsp;</span><br />
We only accept client funds where they arise from or are in relation to an underlying transaction on which we have been engaged by you as the client.</p>

<p>If, after a reasonable period of due diligence (generally five&nbsp;working days), we cannot identify funds we have received as arising from a transaction on which we are engaged we will either retain the funds pending further investigation or may at our discretion return them to the originator bank.</p>

<p>We maintain separately identified client accounts with a bank or banks of our choosing. These are presently held with Lloyds Bank plc in London. Separate accounts are maintained for our clients&#39; principal operating currencies, presently Pounds Sterling, Euros and United States Dollars.</p>

<p>You use our client accounts at your own risk. We accept no liability for loss or damage you suffer if our bank collapses or for reasons outside our control our bank is otherwise unable to transact business or transfer funds in a timely manner or at all.</p>

<p>All client funds will be held in instant access general client accounts unless we and you as the client agree otherwise. Money on client accounts no longer attracts any interest.</p>

<p><span class="title3">Anti-Money Laundering</span><br />
In common with other law firms and professionals in the UK, we are bound to comply with the requirements of UK anti-money laundering law.&nbsp;This involves our taking positive steps in relation to our dealings with clients and matters on which we are working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>UK Money Laundering Regulations require us (except in certain limited circumstances) to carry out due diligence on all our clients.&nbsp;This involves, among other things, identifying and verifying the identity of our clients and, where applicable, their ultimate beneficial owners.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that the UK&#39;s anti-money laundering legislation, especially the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, may require us to report matters (including known or suspected money laundering) to the relevant authorities in circumstances where we may be precluded from informing you that we have done so.&nbsp;This may affect what we can do and how we do it, and it may also have an effect on timescales.</p>

<p>If we engage others (including another K&amp;L Gates entity) to act on your behalf then additional due diligence may be required and or the results of our own due diligence shared with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may from time to time use online information sources, including electronic verification, to meet our client due diligence obligations pursuant to anti money laundering legislation.</p>

<h5>Compulsory Professional Indemnity Insurance</h5>

<p>We maintain compulsory professional indemnity insurance of at least &pound;3 million, each and every claim. The name of our insurer for the current policy period (1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022) is Liberty Mutual Insurance Europe Limited.

<p><span class="title3">Our Organisational Structure</span><br />
K&amp;L Gates LLP is part of K&amp;L Gates, a global law firm operating through a number of separately constituted and regulated legal entities which provide legal and other client services in accordance with the relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which they respectively operate.&nbsp; References in this statement to &quot;the Firm&quot; and &quot;K&amp;L Gates&quot; are to the K&amp;L Gates global law firm.</p>

<p><span class="title3">Overview</span><br />
K&amp;L Gates is committed to the highest standards of professionalism, ethical behaviour and integrity in everything we do and to contributing to the wellbeing of communities around the world.&nbsp;In this we are committed to opposing modern slavery in all its forms, and do not tolerate it either within our law practice or within our supply chain.</p>

<p>We are committed to acting in an ethical manner, with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to creating effective systems and controls to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within our law practice or our supply chain.</p>

<p>K&amp;L Gates LLP is a professional services provider that predominantly employs professionally qualified and highly skilled people.&nbsp;We consider the risk of modern slavery occurring within our law practice to be low.</p>

<p>This statement sets out the steps that K&amp;L Gates LLP and the Firm have undertaken - and are continuing to take - to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our law practice or our supply chain.</p>

<p><span class="title3">Our Policies</span><br />
We have adopted or are working to adopt a number of internal policies to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner.&nbsp;These include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy, which sets out the Firm&#39;s stance on modern slavery and explains how employees can identify any instances of this and where they can go for help.</li>
	<li>Whistleblowing policy, which ensures all employees know they can raise concerns about how colleagues are being treated, or practices within our law practice or supply chain, without fear of reprisals.</li>
	<li>Supplier code of conduct, which sets out the standards required of the Firm&#39;s suppliers.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="title3">Our Suppliers</span><br />
As K&amp;L Gates is a global enterprise, it hires suppliers in many locations and performs a reasonable level of due diligence before engaging any supplier.</p>

<p>This due diligence includes an online search at the outset of any engagement to ensure that the particular organisation has never been convicted of offences relating to modern slavery.</p>

<p>It is the Firm&#39;s intent that our anti-slavery policy forms part of our contract with all suppliers and they are requested to confirm that no part of their business operations contradicts this policy.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, as part of our contract with suppliers, we request that they confirm to us that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>They have taken steps to eradicate modern slavery within their business</li>
	<li>They hold their own suppliers to account over modern slavery</li>
	<li>(For UK-based suppliers) They pay their employees at least the national minimum wage/national living wage (as appropriate)</li>
	<li>(For international suppliers) They pay their employees any prevailing minimum wage applicable within their country of operations</li>
	<li>We may terminate the contract at any time should any instances of modern slavery come to light.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="title3">Training</span><br />
Our intent is to regularly conduct modern slavery training for our procurement teams/staff/employees/contractors so that they are aware of the issues surrounding modern slavery and know what to do if they suspect that it is taking place within our supply chain.</p>

<p><span class="title3">Our Performance Indicators</span><br />
We will routinely monitor our law practice and supply chain to identify any parts that carry a potential risk of modern slavery, and we will take steps to assess and manage those risks.</p>

<p>We intend to implement a programme of regular meetings with our key suppliers to identify and manage any risks of modern slavery.&nbsp;The frequency of these meetings will be dictated by a number of factors, including consideration of the risks posed by involvement in modern slavery. Our standard contract terms contain a contractual right to audit our suppliers.</p>

We are required by our professional rules of conduct to publish certain details in relation to certain services.&nbsp;The following sections cover those services which we do not provide as part of our usual business and those services which we do provide and in respect of which the required details are set out below.</p>

<p><span class="title3">Services We Do Not Provide</span><br />
As part of our usual business we do not provide any of the following services.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For members of the public: residential conveyancing, probate, immigration applications, asylum applications, motoring offences,&nbsp;or advising employees on claims for unfair or wrongful dismissal.</li>
	<li>For businesses: debt recovery (up to &pound;100,000), licensing applications for business premises or advising employers on wrongful dismissal claims brought in the Employment Tribunal where the value of the claim is currently limited to &pound;25,000.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="title3">Defending Unfair Dismissal Claims in the Employment Tribunal</span></p>

<p><strong>We advise businesses on defending unfair dismissal claims in the Employment Tribunal and in that connection we are required by our professional standards and regulations to notify you of the following</strong></p>

<h6><em>Our pricing for advising employers on defending claims for unfair dismissal</em></h6>

<p>For defending a simple unfair dismissal case, we would typically charge &pound;40,000 plus VAT (at 20%) and disbursements (typically the types of disbursements are as described below). We use an hourly rate per lawyer (detailed below) to calculate the charge.</p>

<p>A simple unfair dismissal case is one which involves no more than three witnesses (including the claimant), involves the use of no more than one lever arch file of documents at the hearing and a hearing length of no more than one day (starting and ending on the same day).</p>

<h6><em>What services are included?</em></h6>

<p>The fee set out above covers all of the work in relation to the following key stages of a claim:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Taking your initial instructions, reviewing the papers and advising you on merits and likely damages (this is likely to be revisited throughout the matter and subject to change);</li>
	<li>Entering into pre-claim conciliation to explore whether a settlement can be reached;</li>
	<li>Preparing a response;</li>
	<li>Exploring settlement and negotiating settlement throughout the process;</li>
	<li>Considering a schedule of loss;</li>
	<li>Preparing for (and attending) one Preliminary Hearing dealing with case management;</li>
	<li>Exchanging documents with the other party and agreeing a bundle of documents;</li>
	<li>Taking witness statements, drafting statements, agreeing their content with witnesses and exchanging witness statements with the Claimant;</li>
	<li>Preparing bundle of documents;</li>
	<li>Reviewing and advising on the other party&#39;s witness statements; and</li>
	<li>Preparation and attendance at Final Hearing, including instructions to Counsel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stages set out above are an indication and if some of the stages above are not required, or if the claim settles at an earlier stage without the need for a hearing, the fee will be reduced.</p>

<h6><em>What is not included?</em></h6>

<ul>
	<li>Any advice provided in relation to an unfair dismissal claim which is not a simple claim, for example where there are more than three witnesses (including the claimant), more than one lever arch file of documents or where the hearing is listed to last for more than one day;</li>
	<li>If it is necessary to make or defend applications to amend claims or to provide further information about an existing claim;</li>
	<li>Defending claims that are brought by litigants in person;</li>
	<li>Making or defending a costs application;</li>
	<li>Complex preliminary issues such as whether the claimant is a whistleblower;</li>
	<li>Allegations of discrimination which are linked to the dismissal;</li>
	<li>Disbursements: these are costs related to your matter that are payable to third parties, such as photocopying or printing charges, any travel expenses, courier fees and barristers&#39; fees. &nbsp;We handle the payment of the disbursements on your behalf to ensure a smoother process. &nbsp;These disbursements will vary depending on the requirements of the matter so we are unable to give an example of the typical level of disbursements. However, we will keep you informed of any significant disbursements as the matter proceeds. The most significant disbursement is likely to be a barrister&#39;s fee, the cost of which varies with experience of the barrister and which we will discuss with you; and</li>
	<li>If the employer loses the claim, preparing for and representing the employer at any subsequent remedies hearing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above becomes relevant, the cost will increase.&nbsp;We will provide you with a separate fee estimate (including estimate of the barrister&#39;s fee) at the outset of the relevant matter or stage in proceedings.</p>

<p>If a simple unfair dismissal claim is listed for one day but it does not finish on that day (meaning that the claim is part-heard), there will be an additional charge for attending the second and subsequent days of the hearing of &pound;1,250 per day (plus VAT at 20 percent).</p>

<h6><em>Timescales and key stages - how long will my matter take?</em></h6>

<p>The time that it takes from taking your initial instructions to the final resolution of your matter depends largely on the stage at which your case is resolved.&nbsp;If a settlement is reached during pre-claim conciliation, the claim is likely to take two to four&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp;If the claim proceeds to a final hearing, the claim is likely to take six to&nbsp;12 months. This is just an estimate and we will of course be able to give you a more accurate timescale once we have more information and as the matter progresses.</p>

<p>The key stages of defending a simple unfair dismissal claim are set out above under the heading &quot;What services are included?&quot;</p>

<h6><em>Who will carry out the work?</em></h6>

<p>Your claim will be handled by a team of one or more employment lawyers in London who are dedicated to the practice of employment law.&nbsp;That team consists of <a href="http://www.klgates.com/paul-callegari/">Paul Callegari</a> (Partner) (current hourly rate of &pound;755 plus VAT (at 20 percent))&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.klgates.com/natalie-taylor">Natalie Taylor</a>&nbsp;(Associate) (current hourly rate of &pound;350 plus VAT (at 20 percent)).

                        <button class="s-section-expander__btn"><span class="s-plus">+</span><span class="s-minus">-</span><h3 class="s-section-expander__heading">Employment Background Investigation Policy -- U.S.</h3></button>
                        <div class="s-section-expander__body s-wb-content"><p><strong>Purpose.</strong> This policy establishes guidelines for implementing a position-related, consistent, and non-discriminatory pre-employment background investigation as part of the recruiting selection process. A background check of a candidate for employment purposes is performed to promote a safe work environment, protect the firm&rsquo;s and clients&rsquo; assets, including employees, property, and information, as well as to assist departments in their hiring decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Administration.</strong> The Human Resources Department shall have the authority to designate those firm positions that shall require a background check, as well as the type of background check(s) applicable to the position. Types of background inquiries could include, but are not limited to, a trace on Social Security number, criminal history, civil record, employment, credit records, and a search for termination with cause.</p>

<p><strong>Candidate Notification and Consent.</strong> Candidates will be made aware of the background check procedures during the application process. The background check process will only be initiated for a staff or non-partner level lawyer applicant once it has been determined that he or she is a final candidate. Background checks will not be initiated until disclosure and consent is provided by the candidate, to the extent required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and/or State laws. If the candidate refuses to provide consent, then no further consideration for employment, promotion or reassignment will be given to the individual.</p>

<p><strong>Initiation.</strong> When a background check is required for a position, the assigned recruiter shall initiate the background check by requesting that an e-mail invitation be sent by the firm&rsquo;s background check vendor to the candidate. The candidate will follow a link provided in this e-mail and enter the required information into the background check vendor&rsquo;s secure Internet form. The candidate will be required to provide an electronic signature as part of this process. If the candidate cannot complete the form online, the recruiter will instead provide the candidate with a hard copy Disclosure and Consent form to be completed and signed. Failure by a candidate to consent to a required background check shall result in the candidate&rsquo;s disqualification, as described above. After the candidate has completed the online process or authorization form, the background check will commence with the appropriate background check(s) required for that position.</p>

<p><strong>Adjudication.</strong> The Background Check Coordinator (&ldquo;BCC&rdquo;) will receive the background check results (&ldquo;Consumer Report&rdquo;) from the background check vendor. The report will contain a score of either ���meets company standards&rdquo; or &ldquo;does not meet company standards&rdquo; for each candidate investigated. A score of &ldquo;meets company standards&rdquo; is required to proceed with the hire or for consideration for promotion.</p>

<p>If a score of &quot;does not meet company standards&rdquo; is received, the BCC will review all adverse information. He or she will consult with the background check vendor to ensure that all information received is in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. The BCC will also research any state-specific restrictions related to the type of information that the firm is legally permitted to consider when making employment decisions. All findings, along with the candidate&rsquo;s Consumer Report will be presented to the Firm&rsquo;s Office of General Counsel for review.</p>

<p><strong>Adverse Action.</strong> Prior to taking any adverse action, the firm will consider the nature and severity of the offense(s), the time elapsed since the offense(s) occurred, the nature and level of responsibility attributed to the open position, as well as any other lawful and appropriate considerations. A final determination will be made by General Counsel as to whether the candidate should &ldquo;pass&rdquo; or &quot;fail&rdquo; a background investigation.<br />
If the Firm&rsquo;s decision to not offer a position to a candidate is based in whole or in part on information obtained from the background investigation, the background check vendor will proceed with the adverse action notification process, to the extend required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and/or state laws.</p>

<p>If it is determined that the candidate should receive a &ldquo;does not meet company standards&rdquo; score, the background check vendor will issue a pre-adverse action notice to the candidate via US mail within 24 hours. This notification will inform the candidate that negative information was obtained via the background investigation process and that this information may have an adverse impact on the firm&rsquo;s decision to hire the candidate. A copy of the candidate&rsquo;s Consumer Report and of &ldquo;A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act&rdquo; will be enclosed with this letter along with any forms required by state law. The candidate will be allowed five (5) business days or longer designated time period if required by state law to dispute the accuracy or completeness of these findings directly with the background check vendor.</p>

<p>If a candidate does not contact the background check vendor or is unable to disprove the negative findings in the consumer report within five (5) business days or longer designated time period if required by state law, an adverse action notice will be mailed to the candidate by the background check vendor. This letter will advise the candidate of the firm&rsquo;s decision not to hire, promote or transfer him or her due to disqualifying information revealed in the Consumer Report.</p>
