            <p> Dear LPRA Member, 2020 will be the LPRA’s 30th Anniversary, an achievement we are justly proud of and a milestone that has only been achieved thanks to the support of our members.2019 has been another challenging year,  the prolonged uncertainty caused by the prospect of the UK’s exit from the EU and the escalating use of tariffs has contributed to the continued global environment of caution. These elements, combined with the aggressive global battle for precious radio spectrum make the LPRA’s role even more vital and we are proud to be maintaining our mission to protect the interests of our members.  Despite these difficulties our members continue to be at the forefront of innovation in our industry, through their creativity, resilience and adaptability, something which always makes me proud to see.I would like to take this opportunity to again thank LPRA Member Nedap for their generous hosting and sponsorship of the Radio Solutions Conference and Networking event RS2019. <a href="/news/new-article-page-74/" class="readmore" title="Read more on &quot;LPRA CHAIRMAN&#039;S YEAR END LETTER JANUARY 2020&quot;">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
