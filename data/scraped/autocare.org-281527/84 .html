We are a strong advocate of privacy enhancing
    technologies including encryption. By default, the Sites encrypt connections between client devices and our servers to minimize the ability of any third party to “eavesdrop” on Your Data. In addition, where feasible, data is stored encrypted.
    If your browser does not support HTTPS encryption, you are encouraged to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:info@autocare.org">info@autocare.org</a> or in writing to the address set forth above.&nbsp; Our databases and system administration logs,
    are restricted to access by authorized and authenticated users. We use reasonable industry security standard safeguards (which may include physical, procedural and technical measures) to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data.
    We take reasonable steps to ensure that Your Data is complete and relevant to its intended use. We will take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Your Data.</p><p><strong>Cross Border Transfers</strong></p><p>If you visit our Sites from a country other than the United States, your communications will likely result in the transfer of Your Data across national borders. Our servers or offices may be located in countries other than the country from which you access
    our Sites, also resulting in the transfer of Your Data across international borders. If you provide Your Data when visiting one of our Sites from outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that this data may be transferred from your then
    current location to our offices and servers and to those of our affiliates, agents, and service providers located in the United States and in other countries. <strong>The United States and such other countries may not have the same level of data protection as those that apply in the jurisdiction where you live.</strong></p><p>For Site visitors who reside in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, we will only transfer Your Data&nbsp; (a) to jurisdictions with “adequate protection” as used in the General Data Protection Regulation governing
    transfer of personal data outside of the European Union (the “GDPR”), or (b) to recipients with appropriate safeguards in place, including where contractual arrangements exist which include Standard Contractual Clauses (as defined in the
    GDPR) without any additions, modifications, or omissions</p><p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p><p>We will only retain Your Data stored on our servers in accordance with the legitimate needs of our business and as required or permitted by applicable law. &nbsp;We will not retain any unused Personal Data on our systems longer than necessary for legitimate
    business purposes or we no longer have a valid legal basis for retaining the information.</p><a name="cookie-policy"></a><p><strong>Use of Cookies; Technical Information Collection</strong></p><p>Our Sites use third parties for web analytics services, including Google Analytics, to collect Technical Information.&nbsp; Along with these third parties we do or may use “cookies” or similar technologies, which are text files placed on your
    computer, to help analyze how you use a Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of a Site (including your IP address) will be stored in the United States. This information will be used to evaluate your use of our Sites, compiling
