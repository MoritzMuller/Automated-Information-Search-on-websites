                <h1>Our history</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scotland and Europe have seen significant historical and political changes over the past decades both historically and politically. The representation of Scotland to the EU, which began in the 1970s, has gone from strength to strength in this ever changing climate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The establishment of Scotland Europa in 1992 aimed to ensure Scotland is a proactive European player in Brussels, giving Scottish interests a strong voice in the EU.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a constantly changing environment, Scotland Europa has grown and adapted, changing the way we work, expanding our networks and relationships, maximising opportunities and most importantly striving to deliver a mutually beneficial relationship between Scotland and the EU. This is an evolution, which has been guided by our membership and Scottish Enterprise. With an enlarged EU and an ever greater number of interest representatives in Brussels, Scotland Europa is committed to strengthen and deepen our ties with other countries, regions and the European Institutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been no small endeavour to reach this point in our evolution as an organisation, and we invite you to discover more on the establishment, growth and change of Scotland Europa.</p>

              <h2>Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design</h2>
              <p>2016 has been a politically tumultuous year for Scotland, starting with Scottish Parliament elections that returned Scotland’s third SNP Government. Later, the UK vote to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.</p>
<p>Our annual members’ meeting on 8 September, hosted by new member Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) in Inverness, was the first opportunity since 23 June for a large group of EU stakeholders in Scotland to reflect on the outcome of the referendum, and on how we can continue our EU engagement work together to deliver value for Scotland and our EU partners.</p>
<p>Finally, the Scottish Government published ‘<a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/12/9234">Scotland’s Place in Europe</a>’ in December, which set out its position following the result of the EU Referendum.</p>
<p>2016 is Scotland’s Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design, and as a result our annual summer reception, hosted in partnership with the Scottish Government EU Office and the Highlands and Islands European Partnership, celebrated Scotland’s achievements in innovation, breathtaking architecture and bold design.</p>
<p>Scotland, represented by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, was selected by the European Commission as one of six model demonstrator regions that the EU will support in developing sustainable chemicals production in Europe. Scotland Europa coordinated the application and the accolade will allow Scotland to access strategic advice and support from the Commission to maximise investments in sustainable chemistry, circular economy and the bioeconomy over the next two years. In addition to the expert advice, the opportunity for cooperation with other model demonstrator regions will help chemical science companies and SE/HIE extend international networks.</p>
<p>The City of Glasgow was also a finalist in the competition to become Europe’s Capital of Innovation.</p>
<p>In light of Scotland’s refreshed Agenda for Cities and the developing EU Urban Agenda, Scotland Europa, in partnership with the Scottish Government, hosted an afternoon policy seminar on the role of cities in Europe’s future as drivers of sustainable economic development, climate action and social inclusion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the European Week of Regions and Cities took place in Brussels between 10 and 13 October, with the theme of Regions and Cities for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. Scotland Europa hosted an event with the Scottish Cities Alliance entitled "Inter-city approaches to funding and delivering Smart City Ambitions.” We also hosted a debate entitled <strong>“</strong>Renaissance for Remote Rurban Regions through Research – the Case of Less Urban Areas in the North” with Highlands and Islands Enterprise<strong>,</strong> followed by an evening reception.</p>
<p>We hosted a workshop as part of EU Design Days in collaboration with ERRIN (European Regions Research and Innovation Network) and Zero Waste Scotland, which was a platform for stakeholders in design to come together to address economic, financial, environmental, social, or political issues through design. The workshop hosted by Scotland Europa was organised in partnership with Cornwall and Birmingham West Midlands, focusing on ‘<a href="https://portal.scotlandeuropa.com/event-listings/view/2">Design for a Circular Economy</a>’.</p>
<p>This year’s St Andrews Lecture was delivered by Dame Mariot Leslie, a former British diplomat whose final role before leaving the diplomatic service was as Permanent Representative to NATO. The title of the lecture was “A world in flux: Scotland in a new global context”, and explored the future for Scotland in a post-Brexit world.</p>
<p>We were delighted to welcome Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) as our newest member. HIE is also a core partner of the Highlands and Islands European Partnership, which this year intensified its European work by recruiting a Policy Officer based in Inverness to coordinate the Partnership’s European work.</p>
<p>This year our team also expanded to welcome Stephanie Abrahams as EU Policy Assistant and Philip Piatkiewicz as Senior EU Policy Executive, both in our Brussels office.</p>

              <h2>Year of Food and Drink</h2>
              <p>2015 saw yet more political change for Scotland, with a General Election and the announcement of the UK Government’s plan to hold a referendum on the future of British EU membership. We kicked off the year with our members’ planning meeting, and were delighted that so many members were able to join us in Edinburgh on 18 February.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="http://www.scotland.org/features/2015-the-year-of-food-drink">Scotland’s Year of Food and Drink</a>, we hosted our annual summer reception in partnership with the Scottish Government EU Office and with the East of Scotland European Consortium, one of our most longstanding members. The reception celebrated Scotland’s fantastic larder and exceptional produce, served as the launch for the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/appliedName.html?denominationId=21301">bid for EU Protected Geographical Indication status of the Forfar Bridie</a>. Guests heard from Jamie Scott, winner of MasterChef: The Professionals 2014.</p>
<p>The 2015 Year of Food and Drink was a precursor for our new way of planning our yearly activities and promoting and positioning Scotland Europa’s members’ work in the context of Scotland’s themed years. Scotland House hosted a number of events, including the European Launch of the Scottish EU Funding Portal, an online resource for Scottish organisations interested in EU funding and for international organisations wishing to work with Scottish organisations. The portal is a partnership project between Scotland Europa, the Scottish Government, East of Scotland European Consortium, West of Scotland European Forum, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Highlands and Islands European Partnership.</p>
<p>In our other areas, we coordinated an <a href="https://portal.scotlandeuropa.com/case-studies/10">EU nature working group</a> with our members that have an interest in environmental legislation after the European Commission launched an evaluation of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. This resulted in a joint consultation response bringing together input from nine members.</p>
<p>During EU Sustainable Energy Week, we hosted a joint Scotland Europa and Scottish Government event in Scotland House which showcased sustainable islands projects across Europe, including the Orkney smart grid project.</p>
<p><em>The collective Scottish presence at Green Week was the most considerable and noticeable for a number of years …a strong contingent of representation across the wider Scottish community demonstrated our level of commitment to the need to value our natural resources as part of our economic and social wealth and the importance of exchange of best practices across the EU ... Wider Scotland was well represented at EU Green Week 2015, with the Scottish Government EU Office working closely together with Scotland Europa to coordinate and maximise synergies between the Ministerial presence and the Scotland Europa environment-focused membership contingent attending.</em></p>
<p>Our St Andrews Lecture was delivered by Alex Paterson, the Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and was entitled “The HIE Road – A 50 year journey in economic and community development” and focussed on the transformation of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland as a region since the foundation of Highlands and Islands Enterprise in 1965.</p>

              <h2>Year of Homecoming</h2>
              <p>2014 is heralding a year of change, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)">European Parliament election</a> results yielded two Labour, two SNP, one Conservative and one UKIP MEPs (SNP: Alyn Smith and Ian Hudghton; Labour: David Martin and Catherine Stihler; Conservative: Ian Duncan and UKIP: David Coburn)</p>
<p>We hosted our annual end of term summer reception marking another year of joint working with our Brussels based partners, networks and colleagues, with a special welcome to the returning and newly elected MEPs.</p>
<p>Scotland Europa co-organised two events as part of EU Sustainable Energy Week in Brussels. The first event ‘Delivering the Wider Benefits of Renewable Energy into Transport for Cities and Communities’, was organised, in association with the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland, and the Scottish Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Association (SHFCA), and explored how European partnerships, collaboration and uptake of EU funding opportunities can assist the transport sector in the wider deployment of renewable technologies. The second event, ‘Creative Finance for the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy’, was organised in cooperation with the Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Low Carbon Investment Programme. It brought together policy makers and industry representatives to look at low-carbon financing from different angles. The events were followed by an evening reception.</p>
<p>After more than seven years as part of the Scotland Europa team Luca Polizzi left the organisation. Edward Ricketts joined the team in Brussels as Senior EU Policy Executive, while Alexis Cahill and Ingrid Green joined our team in Scotland.</p>

              <h2>Year of Natural Scotland</h2>
              <p>Croatia joins as the newest member of the European Union on 1 July.</p>
<p>Scotland House hosted the <a href="http://www.scotland.org/whats-on/year-of-natural-scotland">Year of Natural Scotland</a> Exhibition which featured pictures from the famous National Geographic photographer Jim Richardson in our conference centre. The exhibition is in keeping with the theme across the Scottish tourist sector which celebrates our country’s wealth of natural wonders. In conjunction with this our annual St. Andrews Lecture was delivered by Nigel Pope, executive producer of the 2013 BBC Series ‘<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p014g3q2">Hebrides: Islands on the Edge</a>’. His lecture entitled ‘Taking Wild Scotland to the World’ featured breathtaking imagery from the series while delving into health of the Natural History Production Industry in Scotland, and its knock-on effects and interlinkages with the tourism and creative sectors, and the prospect of the Scottish Production Industry competing with acclaimed existing hubs such as Bristol’s BBC Natural History Unit.</p>
<p>Our Spring Members’ Meeting was hosted in Inverness by the University of the Highlands and Islands, where we discussed the priorities of the Irish Presidency of the EU and discussed with our members the Scotland Europa Forward Work Plan for 2013-2014</p>
<p>On 25 June, as part of the EU Sustainable Energy Week, Scotland Europa, in conjunction with The European Energy Association and the Scottish Government, hosted a high-level policy conference entitled “The risk and rewards from emerging renewable technologies” on the important role of innovative finance for emerging, higher risk technologies using the case of ocean renewable energy.</p>
<p>The conference demonstrated an effective approach which combines leverage of investment together with committed efforts to increase the efficiency and reduce costs of the technology, while boosting the supply chain and creating links with established related sectors. The session provided an overview of current ocean energy best practices and an emerging policy and support framework for development of the sector. The conference format allowed an exchange of know-how between industry, decision makers, researchers and the finance and investment community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scotlandeuropa.com/news-events/news/2013/08/horizon-2020-scottish-support-framework.aspx">Horizon 2020 Scottish Support Framework</a> – <i>Delivering a collaborative, strategic approach to EU Research and Innovation engagement for Scotland. </i>The Scottish EU Research and Innovation Steering Group jointly developed a Horizon 2020 Scottish Support Framework to enhance Scottish participation and influence in the new EU framework programme for research and innovation – Horizon 2020. Between March and July 2013 over 400 attendees participated in the series of Horizon 2020 Awareness Sessions that took place throughout Scotland. These sessions provided an in-depth look at the structure of Horizon 2020 and considered the broad opportunities we anticipate the Programme offers for Scotland. The first phase of this support framework consisted of a series of awareness raising sessions across Scotland with the aim of increasing understanding and supporting engagement in the opportunities under Horizon 2020.</p>

              <h2>20 Years of Networking Scotland in Europe</h2>
              <p>On 11 July Scotland Europa held its first event marking its 20th Anniversary. The event was hosted at Scotland House in Brussels, with over 100 people in attendance; giving the Scotland Europa team the opportunity to thank all our Brussels based partners and colleagues for 20 years of networking Scotland in Europe. Our new Chairman Grahame Smith was also in attendance and gave a compelling speech on Scotland Europa’s journey so far.</p>
<p>Some of the attendees were kind enough to give us some congratulatory remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Thank you for building the foundations for Scotland’s EU engagement with the EU”</em> Ian Campbell, Scottish Government EU Office</li>
<li><em>“Let’s work together for the next 20 years”</em> Ana Coelho, ACC1Ó – Government of Catalonia</li>
<li><em>“Congratulations on 20 years! Here’s to networking forever!”</em> Ian Duncan, Scottish Parliament</li>
<li><em>“Hoping, for at least another 20 years of cooperation!”</em> Sven Kastö, Småland Blekinge South Sweden</li>
</ul>
<p>Our 20th Anniversary Members’ Meeting took place in the Scottish Parliament members’ restaurant on 7 September and was hosted by Christina McKelvie MSP, Convener of the European and External Relations Committee. The meeting had speakers with a wide variety of associations to Scotland Europa. Former Chief Executives including Charlie Woods and Ray Perman reflected on Scotland Europa’s work over the last 20 years, Fabian Zuleeg – the European Policy Centre’s Chief Economist, spoke on Scotland’s place in Europe’s 2020 vision and a panel discussion looked at how Scotland Europa had learned and changed in the past 20 years, and how we’re using this experience now and in years ahead.</p>
<p>As part of our 20th Anniversary activities is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcSXqzGuayk">creation of a reflective video</a> which highlights the breadth of our activity and diversity of our Membership Organisations.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.islesproject.eu/%20">ISLES Project</a> which aimed to facilitate the development of offshore renewables in Scotland and Ireland ranked highest during the Cross-Border final project call. Scotland Europa played a key role in ensuring the engagement of Scottish stakeholders in the implementation of the programme using services and networks to support the development, funding and implementation of a strategic EU project.</p>
<p>Scotland Europa has been supporting Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL) with the development of a strategic funding plan supporting their aspirations to lead the way in the development of Hybrid Ferry technology for Europe. Following the success of their Interreg IVA Cross Border project to develop a common design and procurement strategy for small ferries which could be used by each of the three jurisdictions, CMAL has been awarded a further £450,000 from the Highlands and Islands ERDF programme to develop the world’s first two sea going Roll On Roll Off vehicle and passenger diesel electric hybrid ferries. The success of this project relied heavily on strong networking at the European level, facilitated through Scotland Europa. The ERDF project also attracted private support from SSE. Scotland Europa have supported CMAL to promote these projects across the EU, create opportunities to meet potential partners and develop future consortia which will enable further EU funding opportunities to be taken forward.</p>
<p>Ray Perman, who was chairman of Scotland Europa since 2007, stepped down and was replaced by Grahame Smith, General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress.</p>
<p>Former EU Policy and Events Stagiaires Lynne Ross and Charles Abbott joined the Scotland Europa Brussels office as EU Policy Assistants.</p>

              <h2>Journey through continuity and change</h2>
              <p>On 11 April Scotland Europa, in partnership with the Scottish Government and the Scottish European Green Energy Centre, hosted a conference as part of the European Commission's EU Sustainable Energy Week. The conference focused on energy efficiency, in light of the Commission's newly released Energy Efficiency Plan 2011. A Scottish Government official presented the work being done by the Scottish Government in the field of energy efficiency. Colleagues from the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the University of Edinburgh and the Traffic Agency in Oslo also gave presentations. A panel discussion followed the presentations, with contributions from Fiona Hall MEP, the European Investment Bank, SSE and the Climate Group. Jennifer Rankin, Energy Journalist at the European Voice, chaired the conference.</p>
<p>On 25 May, we hosted, in partnership with the Scottish Government, a conference as part of Green Week 2011. The conference focused on resource efficiency, reflecting the European Commission's Resource Efficiency Flagship Initiative. The conference was chaired by David Crawley, a member of the Board of Scottish Natural Heritage. There were contributions from the Scottish Government, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and Scottish Enterprise.</p>
<p>SubRosa published a report entitled, “Cohesion Policy – A springboard to sustainable economic growth” and pointed out that within the debate on the particularities of further policies, there is a danger of losing sight of the broader strategic questions of what the Cohesion Policy is for, and how it can most effectively support regional economic and social development in the many different types of European regions.</p>
<p>The St Andrew’s Day Lecture was given by Professor Louise Richardson, the Principal of St. Andrews University entitled ‘St Andrews into the 600th year: journey through continuity and change’.</p>
<p>This year’s Members’ Meeting, held at Edinburgh City Council’s conference centre, looked at the nature of Scotland’s presence in Europe. Several speakers including Dr Ian Duncan, the former Clerk of the Scottish Parliament European and External Relations Committee, Elspeth MacDonald and Neil Watt of the Scottish Government updated our members on the Scottish Government’s European Engagement Action Plan.</p>
<p>In light of the Europe 2020 growth strategy which was adopted in 2010, our annual EU Insight Familiarisation Visit to Brussels on the 20 – 21 June was entitled "Europe 2020: Towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth", the programme provided insight into the EU in the context of its overarching economic growth strategy for the coming decade, and looked at the priorities of the new Council of the EU.</p>
<p>On 1 December 2011, Scotland Europa and the Scottish Government hosted a policy seminar “EU Research &amp; Innovation Policy - Unlocking the potential of SMEs”. The event explored the support available for SMEs and how EU and national/regional instruments can be tailored to meet the needs of SMEs and research.

              <h2>SubRosa on Sustainable Growth</h2>
              <p>On 26 January, Scotland Europa, in collaboration with the Scottish Government, co-hosted the popular Burns' Reception in Scotland House. Students from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music &amp; Drama provided guests with an interesting and entertaining insight into the work of Robert Burns with a performance which included some of his most memorable work.</p>
<p>As part of Sustainable Energy Week, Scotland Europa in conjunction with the Scottish Government, Scottish European Green Energy Centre and the EU Offshore Energy Association hosted a seminar looking at the challenges involved in developing the Marine Energy sector on 22 March. The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Richard Lochhead, opened the event which was attended by the European Investment Bank, the European Commission, the Chair of the Scottish European Green Energy Centre and a number of electricity utilities. A great deal of discussion focussed on the absence of public funding to facilitate the deployment and demonstration of marine technologies on a large scale and the need for an Industrial initiative to develop the sector strategically.</p>
<p>In June, SubRosa published a report on Sustainable Growth and identified key areas in which European Institutions and Governments could make progress in stimulating more sustainable development.</p>
<p>On 7 October, the Scottish folk group Breabach performed at a cultural event. The event was organised by the Celtic Connections Brussels partnership, which includes Scotland Europa, the Scottish Government and the Highlands &amp; Islands European Partnership. This was a first time venture to bring up and coming acts from the Celtic Nations to perform together in Brussels and the evening also featured acts from Galicia, Ireland and Wales. This hugely successful event was held at La Tentation, the Galician Cultural Centre in the heart of Brussels and over 300 guests attended. The event was timed to coincide with the Committee of the Regions Open Days during which representatives of the 213 European regions and cities gathered in Brussels for a week of events.</p>

              <h2>2006</h2>
              <p>We hosted a book launch at the evening reception for “A Sense of Belonging to Scotland Further Journeys”. In the annual Scottish Writers’ Series, which lasted from 30 November 2005 to 22 March 2006, featured a reading from the acclaimed Scottish poet Don Paterson. He read from his collection of poems, Landing Light, and also from his book of aphorisms, The Book of Shadows. The event also featured Anne Donavan, the famous Scottish author. She read a piece written especially for the British Council’s UK Presidency series of events, ‘Out of Ourselves’. The final event in the series featured A.L. Kennedy, whose novels and short stories have been widely translated.</p>
<p>SubRosa published a report entitled “Clarity and Transparency: Impact of Existing EU Legislation on Business in Member States” which looked at the barriers which SMEs face when trying to engage with the EU, but also looked at the successes that the EU ought to develop in involving growing enterprises.</p>

              <h2>Our future in Europe</h2>
              <p>We hosted our second Scotland Week, entitled “Our future in Europe” from 9-17 October. We held events that showcased Scotland’s industries and produce including Harris Tweed who hosted a fashion show, a Scottish food and drink reception and seminars which discussed the considerations Scotland must take going into the future, specifically regarding the environment, the sustainability of the rates of fishing and the opportunities available to regions in Europe.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1999_(United_Kingdom)">1999 European Parliament elections</a>, which were the first to apply proportional representation, yielded three Labour, two SNP, two Conservative and one Liberal Democrat MEPs for Scotland (Labour: David Martin, Catherine Stihler, and Bill Miller | SNP: Ian Hudghton, Neil MacCormick | Conservative: Struan Stevenson, John Purvis | Liberal Democrat: Elspeth Attwool)</p>
<p>With the devolution of powers, Scotland Europa’s new office was opened together with the newly established Scottish Government EU offices. On 17 July Scotland Europa moves from Square de Meeûs to Rond-Point Schuman 6 to occupy 2018m² divided over the 8th and 9th floor of the building. All the residents moved with Scotland Europa to take up residence in the new Scotland House. We marked this change of address by hosting our first ever Scotland Week. The event showcased Scottish Industries, culture and produce through a series of events and offered a series of receptions to promote Scotland. The First Minister, Donald Dewar, and the UK Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, hosted a reception to open the week.</p>
<p>Scotland Week took place on 11-15 October entitled ‘Seeing Scotland in a New Light’; Scotland week was a comprehensive presentation of the changing Scotland and its distinctive contribution to Europe. With presentations and discussions ranging from the Renewing Democracy and Devolution, to The Law in Scotland, to Culture, the Arts and Tourism; Scotland Week took the message of Scotland to the European audience.</p>
<p>The highlights of the 1999 events included Jeremy Peat, Chief Economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland and his analysis of the 1999 UK Budget and Will Hutton with the Wise Group on the ‘Changing State we-are in’.</p>

              <h2>New Scotland in a new Europe</h2>
              <p>The Scotland Act was introduced in 1998, following the referendum. It created the Scottish Parliament. With the new political era in Scotland, Scotland Europa saw a change in leadership, with Campbell Christie becoming Chairman.</p>
<p>And with the coming of the Euro as a market currency, Scotland Europa published a paper entitled 'The Euro - How can Scotland face up to the Challenge?’ by Irene Oldfather (then Councillor of North Ayrshire Council). The paper discussed the potential problems and opportunities that would face Scotland with the coming of the Euro and discussed our options regarding interacting with, or even becoming members of, the new currency.</p>

              <h2>Change in Scotland and the EU</h2>
              <p>This was a year that saw great changes both at home and abroad. At home, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Scottish_devolution">Devolution Bill</a> proposed the devolution of powers from Westminster to a Scottish Parliament at Holyrood; and at the EU level the <a href="http://europa.eu/eu-law/decision-making/treaties/index_en.htm">Treaty of Amsterdam</a> sought to reform and enhance the powers of EU institutions and to focus these powers on the employment and the rights of European Citizens.</p>
<p>With the expansion of the residency at Scotland House so the building itself was enlarged, with an additional 300m² rented. The members that joined us were: Braveheart Management, British Energy, Bradley Dunbar Associates, Telford College, Eurodesk, Mid Sweden European Office, East Finland EU Office and European Biomass Industries Association.</p>
<p>Our new conference centre was officially opened on the second St. Andrew’s day lecture by the late Donald Dewar on the ground floor of the Square de Meeûs building, where he said in his speech that devolution would bring us closer to Europe and tie our interests closer still to the work of Scotland Europa:</p>
<p><em>“It is the Government's intention that Scottish Ministers will be involved as closely as possible in UK decision-making on Europe. With the strong voice of a large Member State, we can influence the debate and direction of the EU.”</em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>“Indeed I believe the experience of our European neighbours shows that countries which have decentralised systems of Government can be economically successful, influential on the foreign stage, and a constructive member of the European Union.”</em></p>

              <h2>The first St Andrewâ€™s lecture</h2>
              <p>We hosted our first St. Andrew’s lecture, with the former head of the Industry and Environment Departments of the Scotland Office, Gavin McCrone speaking on the theme of ‘Scotland, a European Perspective’. In the lecture, he described the progression seen in Scotland from a nation economically dependent on heavy industry to a modern, dynamic economy, and emphasised the importance of Scotland’s position in Europe and the nature of our constitutional relationship with the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>The St Andrews’ lecture has since become an annual event, to mark the celebration of Scotland’s patron saint with a speech from a prominent Scot. It is an opportunity for us to invite colleagues and partners in Brussels to Scotland House, to reflect on Scotland's place in the EU and the world, through the thoughts of a guest lecturer.</p>

              <h2>The first Scotland Europa Paper</h2>
              <p>Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the EU, and the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/index_en.htm">Schengen Agreement</a> gave full freedom of travel between seven EU Member States: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal.</p>
<p>With this, Charlie Woods publishes the first issue in our series of Scotland Europa Papers, entitled “Europe’s Regions: Engines or Millstones?” This paper picked up on the topical discussion on the role of the ‘regions’ in European policymaking, and looked to highlight the contributions that regions such as Scotland could make in developing the economy and also promote an understanding of EU issues in relation to Scotland.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_McKenna">Rosemary McKenna</a>, the former President of COSLA, a member of the Scottish Enterprise Board, a Labour Member of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council and a member of the EU's Committee of the Regions, becomes Chair of Scotland Europa. When taking up her post, she was quoted in The Scotsman on 16 June 1995 saying: "I have always felt that Scotland has a lot to gain from being a part of the EU, as well as having a lot to contribute to its future development. I look forward to working with the team to help our members make the most of the EU."</p>

              <h2>Scotland Europa is founded</h2>
              <p>In the year that Scotland Europa was founded, Europe was undergoing fundamental changes to its structure and constitution. With the Maastricht Treaty, Europe’s economic, political and social fabric fundamentally evolved making the EU a much more tangible political entity.</p>
<p>The new 'Scotland Europa Centre' was officially opened on 25 May by the Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Lang at Square de Meeûs 35.</p>
<p>Grant Baird took up post in Brussels as the Chief Executive of Scotland Europa. The first Chair of Scotland Europa was Scottish Enterprise Chief Executive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawford_Beveridge">Crawford Beveridge</a>. He took a lead role in the set up and early running of Scotland Europa and Scotland's representation to the EU.</p>
<p>Whilst continuing to represent the economic development agency, the new company was founded as a membership organisation, to ensure a broad representation of Scottish interests to the EU. The founding Scotland Europa members were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA)</li>
<li>East of Scotland European Consortium</li>
<li>Euro Info Centre</li>
<li>Highlands &amp; Islands European Partnership</li>

The Brussels office takes on the wider remit on the new integrated Economic Development Agency and Scottish Enterprise will take on responsibility for the evolution of the new Scottish presence in Brussels, Scotland Europa. The investment focused functions of LiS Europe transfer back to the Glasgow LiS operation. Sarah Thomson takes responsibility for LiS cover in Europe.</p>

              <p>We moved from Chaussée de Charleroi/Charleroise Steenweg to larger premises on rue Capitaine Crespel/Kapitein Crespelstraat. These offices were chosen with a view that Scottish firms could also establish offices in Brussels, using the premises.<br />
Following two reviews, the case for a distinctive Scottish presence in Brussels was made, and provided the essential data and information necessary to develop Scotland's new presence in Brussels, focused on European Economic Community opportunities, namely SCOTLAND EUROPA LTD.<br />
In December, draft prospectus and a business plan for Scotland Europa was published: “The Company will purchase or lease an appropriate office in Brussels, preferably in the relevant EEC Quarter of the City, of a size that can efficiently accommodate the initial and subsequent growth of the company.” This prospectus also gives information on the financing of the company such as initial capitalisation, expenditure and revenue forecasts etc.</p>

              <p>The SDA commissioned a review of the perception of public and private sector bodies in Scotland towards the desirability of a more co-ordinated and proactive Scottish presence in Brussels, based on comprehensive discussions with the senior executives in thirty different agencies and institutions. This initial feasibility study completed in December 1989 concluded that sufficient strong and widespread support had been expressed to justify the idea of a 'Scottish Centre' to promote Scottish interests in Brussels.</p>

The office premises were situated on Chaussée de Charleroi and the office name was changed to Locate in Scotland (LiS), in line with organisational changes in Scotland.</p>
