Through an improved internal communication and an appropriate “top-down” approach within the network, the MPA managers will be aware about the updates and developments of key MPA policy, decision-making and funding opportunities, especially at European, Mediterranean and International levels. 
 
Overall, MedPAN has generated a strong regional basis that can be engaged to support the implementation of existing governmental agreements, especially the Aichi target 11 and UN SDG14 at international level, the MSFD at European level and the Barcelona Convention MPA Roadmap at Mediterranean level. By providing key elements from the field to better inform decision-makers, MedPAN has an influence at all levels to better implement governmental agreements. 
 
Every 4 years, MedPAN together with the RAC/SPA, organised the Mediterranean MPAs Forum that brought together several actors working on MPAs (managers, scientists, stakeholders, private sector, decision makers, donors...). The Forum enabled to assess the progress made and gauge the road left ahead to effectively reach the 2020 Aichi CBD target. The 2020 Mediterranean MPA Roadmap, elaborated during the 1st Forum in Antalya in 2012, is updated every 4 years. 
 
In relation with the long-term capacity-building strategy for Mediterranean MPAs developed with the RAC/SPA and WWF Mediterranean, MedPAN organises thematic annual sharing-experience workshops, exchange visits and trainings, produces operational tools to capitalize on and spread lessons learnt, brings direct support to MPA managers through calls for small projects; finally, MedPAN keeps its readership updated on current MPA management achievements through its web site and e-newsletter. 
 
MedPAN has developed together with the RAC/SPA, the Mediterranean MPA database (MAPAMED) and the Mediterranean MPA Status Report, the scientific watch and the monitoring resources center to enable managers to be kept abreast of the last science for management achievements.","","","Commission Expert Group on Strategic Coordination for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC)#E02550#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2550#Observer#C#Technical subgroup on Underwater Noise (TG Noise)#Technical Subgroup on Marine Data (TG Data)",8,8,NA,"","International co-operation and development, Environment, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Research and innovation, External Relations, Trans-European Networks, Climate Action","","http://medpan.org/about/medpan/members-and-partners/","01/01/2018","01/12/2018",NA,"1000000-1249999",1191723,"","",NA,"",299427,"INTERREG MED","Romani","Marie","Romani",NA,"Marie","marie","romani",NA,"mr","mr","m.r.",2,"Romani","Marie","Canals","Purificacio","Romani",NA,"Marie","marie","romani",NA,"Canals",NA,"Purificacio","purificacio","canals",NA,0

3 Ensuring that LGBTIQ* families can enjoy fully the European Union’s right to freedom of movement between Member States. 
 
4 NELFA raises awareness about the situation of LGBTIQ* families amongst the public at large. 
 
5 NELFA encourages and promotes initiatives and projects aimed at supporting LGBTIQ* families.

NELFA launched a public petition on 24 September 2013 to Commissioner Viviane Reding: ""Same-sex parents and their children demand true freedom of movement in the European Union: Children of LGBTI parents should not lose their parents when they cross a border!"".

1 Ensuring that the children of LGBTIQ* families in Europe enjoy the same rights as those of children in families currently recognized by the law. 
 
2 Encouraging European countries to adopt equal opportunity policies in relation to LGBTIQ* families with regard to legal, financial, educational, social and other relevant rights. 
 
3 Ensuring that LGBTIQ* families can enjoy fully the European Union’s right to freedom of movement between Member States. 
 
4 NELFA raises awareness about the situation of LGBTIQ* families amongst the public at large. 
 
5 NELFA encourages and promotes initiatives and projects aimed at supporting LGBTIQ* families. 
 
6 NELFA works with EU institutions, Member States and other relevant governmental and civil society partners to achieve the aims stated above.","European","In general, NELFA observes all EU activities concerning LGBTIQ* and families rights (see above), in particular with regard to the freedom of movement Directive (2004/38/EC). This includes i.e. the recognition of civil documents like marriage, birth or adoption certificates. 
 
NELFA launched a public petition on 24 September 2013 to Commissioner Viviane Reding: ""Same-sex parents and their children demand true freedom of movement in the European Union: Children of LGBTI parents should not lose their parents when they cross a border!"". 
 
In July 2018 and April 2019, our Board member Eleni Maravelia was invited to the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament to speak about her own case. See a summary of the presentation here: http://nelfa.org/2018/07/15/nelfa-presentation-brussels-july-2018/ 
 
We have been working together with several EU institutions during the year and gave presentations (IDAHOT events i.e.) or took part in conferences, like in September 2019 in Brussels (Advancing LGBTI equality in 2020 and beyond). More details on the website, for example in the rubric ""NELFA output"". http://nelfa.org/resources/nelfa-output/.","NELFA runs projects (since 2016: Erasmus+, currently REC) to strengthen the network expecially towards its educational activities, i.e. through trainings for Board members and active volunteers on teaching, coaching and leadership skills or job-shadowing at major LGBTIQ* organisations. See more details here: http://nelfa.org/what-we-do/projects/. 
 
NELFA organises regularly workshops or other presentations (i.e. keynote speeches) on different occasions (EP Coman Case lunch seminar in April 2019, IDAHOT in the Committee of the Regions in May or the Gender Equality Index conference in Brussels and the ILGA conference in Prague in October 2019). The network holds its own rainbow family conferences (i.e. Naples 2017, Lisbon 2018, Zagreb 2019) and celebrates each year the ""International Family Equality Day"" and the ""International Day of Families"". Read more here: http://nelfa.org/what-we-do/events/. 
 
NELFA communicates internally via Email list, runs its own website, Facebook and Twitter account and publishes quarterly a newsletter, including Board member activities and recent rainbow families news (current laws and reports, research findings etc.). Read more here: http://nelfa.org/press/newsletter/. In addition, NELFA publishes press releases to comment on recent legislative activities, litigation et cetera.","NELFA is in regular contact with the EP's Intergroup on LGBTI Rights. In the past, we invited MEP's to take part in workshops/conferences to share their expertise (i.e. through a video message). NELFA Board members participated in hearings (i.e. #AllofUs, June 2016) Our last cooperation was a common lunch seminar concerning the Coman case before the European Court of Justice and the consequences in April 2019. An upcoming event is planned for 22nd January 2020. We want also strengthen our ties to the Intergroup on Children's Rights.

During each project we support participants to develop their cultural identity, we overcome barriers they might have, we try to help them to create relevant multicultural environment for learning. Regarding these local and international experiences, experiences with different mobilities, we are able to implement good-quality project. We conducted a plentitude of projects on the European level, which were funded via Erasmus+ Initiative. They were focused on the upholding of human rights and civil liberties, fight against fake news and extremism, protection of environment and healthy lifestyle. 
 
We encourage young people towards volunteering activities by involving them in our events, helping them organize their own small projects, implementing their fresh ideas, giving them a chance to learn about different cultures, participating in international events.","European, national, regional/local","Youth for Equality currently follows Erasmus+ initiative (KA1, KA2 and KA3 projects) and European Solidarity Corps with the aim to achieve the objectives defined in various European Strategic Documents and outcomes of European Structured Dialogues. 
 
Youth for Equality currently plans to organize KA3 Erasmus+ project, i.e. a structured dialogue between the youth and the policy makers, which is going to focus on LGBT Leadership and Activism, incentivising young people to take part in the democratic process and fight for the equality. The outcome of the project will be a strategic report, which will help the policy makers to draft the laws regarding the educational and edificational programs about LGBT Problematics.
